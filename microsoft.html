        <p id="tex">Microsoft Corporation, founded by Bill Gates 
            and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company
             based in Redmond, Washington. Originally a software vendor, 
             it became famous for its Windows operating system and Office
              productivity suite. Over the years, Microsoft has diversified 
              into hardware, cloud computing, and AI. The company operates as a publicly traded entity, with shares
               listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol MSFT. Its average compensation package 
               varies widely by role and location but typically includes a base salary, bonuses, and stock options. 
               Microsoft is also known for its strategic acquisitions. The purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 expanded its presence in the professional networking space, while the acquisition of GitHub in 2018 bolstered its role in the developer community. More recently, the acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022 underscored its commitment to expanding its footprint in the gaming industry.
